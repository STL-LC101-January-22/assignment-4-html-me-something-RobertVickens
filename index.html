         <p>I was born in Lawton, Oklahoma and raised in St. Louis, Missouri.
            My family lived on the North Side of St. Louis on the corner of Kossuth and Gano.
            Every Sunday my grandmother and aunt would cook fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, 
            and other soul food staples. My cousins, my brothers, and I would play in the backyard for hours.
            Life was good. <br>
            My mother and father moved us to the South Side on Dunnica Avenue.
            I attended my first year of high school at Cleveland NJROTC. I earned my rank and achieved the position of
            Admin of my battalion.

         <p>In my second year of high school we moved to West Palm Beach, Florida.
            I attended Palm Beach Central High School. The adjustment was an easy one once I made friends.
            I graduated in 2007 and started attending Palm Beach Community College (now
            Palm Beach State College). I majored in accounting and graduated
            in 2009. After graduating with my AA, I went on to attend Florida Atlantic University (FAU) 
            and majored in accounting and finance. <br>
            After college, I began studying writing as a passion.

         <p>After college, I decided to become a professional writer. I attended a few writing workshops.
            The workshops held at FAU were informative and fun. We wrote and studied fiction as a part of the graduate study program.
            We wrote pieces of original fiction and critiqued each others' work.
            During this time, I began work on my first novel. I submitted the first 
            few chapters to the group, and everyone loved it.

         <p>I began studying coding as a hobby during my writing. I studied hacking and cybersecurity.
            It was fun launching a terminal and exploring my computer. All the books I read and forums I followed
            Javascript was the first coding language I learned and I based my novel 
            on the adventures of a hacker and a psychic.

         <p>I have always enjoyed cooking as a hobby. I learned how to
